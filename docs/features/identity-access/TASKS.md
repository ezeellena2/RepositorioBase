# Identity Access — Tasks

**Status:** In progress. IA-002 and IA-003 are complete; the remaining Identity Access tasks remain pending approval and implementation.

## Review Workload Forecast

Decision needed before apply: No
Chained PRs recommended: Yes
Delivery decision: size:exception (not a chain strategy)
400-line budget risk: High

Suggested units: stack/migrations/test harness; domain/persistence; authorization/registration/session; invitations/outbox/MFA/Platform backend; React/Platform/E2E. The maintainer accepted `size:exception` and direct work on `main`; these units remain mandatory commit, verification, and rollback boundaries.

## Canonical requirement ownership

- IA-005 owns IA-REQ-030/038 and request classification; IA-004 owns IA-REQ-033..036, including stale-write evidence.
- IA-006 owns registration replay; IA-012 owns IA-REQ-041; IA-014 owns IA-REQ-039..040 and IA-REQ-042..046. IA-009 provides evidence only.

## Executable-task contract

Before `Ready`, record actor, preconditions, request marker/permission, tenant scope, files/migration, compile-safe RED, behavioral RED, GREEN/REFACTOR, denial/concurrency/replay tests, audit/outbox behavior, and evidence. Platform tasks additionally prove invitation-before-MFA, bootstrap recovery, MFA freshness, last-owner, reserved-tenant, projection, and prohibited-capability invariants. IA-009 reaches `Review` only after IA-014 Platform verification. IA-001 approves documentation only.
